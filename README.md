# Course Work

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project is done due to the university course work, which aim is to write an application using MVC pattern. As a topic for course work, an online store had been chosen. However it's done more for myselft rather than for the mark.

Current status: in development.

TODO:
1) Rewrite frontend usign Bootstrap
2) Add categories, search
3) Add customer users, buying history and item's review
